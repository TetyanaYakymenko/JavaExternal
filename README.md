Final Project

Conference Management System. There are roles:
Administrator, Moderator, Speaker and normal User.
The moderator can fix, offer, change the theme of the report for
Speaker, as well as adjust the time and place of the event.
It is necessary to take into account the possibility of viewing past / future rallies.
Each speaker has its own rating, depending on the rating
more bonuses are accrued. The Speaker may propose his Report.
There should be statistics of registered people and how much physically
total came to the Report. Implement notification of participants about
upcoming events.
